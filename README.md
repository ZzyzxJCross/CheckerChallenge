# CheckerChallenge by Joshua Cross

This program is intended to let me experiment with genetic learning through the game of checkers. It's also a functional pass and play checkers program.

PLEASE NOTE: This application is in active development and may have many errors. It is intended to be updated frequently in the near future.

## Installation

Use Eclipse IDE's built in github functionality to find this project and import it using File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace.

## Usage

To play, simply run the program and enter in 2 and 1 to the first two prompts on the console. The beginings of the AI will begin to run but will quickly stop. A window will open with a checker board. To move a piece, simply click on it during it's color's turn and then click on a legal space for it to move to. Clicking off of the board will reset it. If you jump a piece, the jumping piece will get a special back ground and you can click on it again and then click on another legal destination space (remember that in this case it needs to jump). To end the turn in this state, simply click off of the board. To terminate the program, simply close the window.
